The Green Kitchen is a website for vegetarians to come and find quick and easy recipes. 

Technologies used:
	html
	css
	skeleton
	ruby/sinatra
	active record
	gulp/less
	sql

Approach taken:
	Created several erb files to import the information from the database onto the corresponding pages. The website is very user friendly.

Problems:
	Realizing that I needed to put a for loop inside a for loop so that I was able to get in correct ingredients to the corresponding recipe from the database.
